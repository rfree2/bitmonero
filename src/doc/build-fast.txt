This doc is mostly deprecated as of 2014-10-10, now the main Makefile should call CMake by default in the "fast" mode.



Fast rebuilds with cmake (on example of linux, similar is for windows).
All builds (after the 1st build especially) will be faster now:
1. cotire (precompiled headers)
2. modules (build just e.g. the wallet, configurable with command "ccmake .." in build/)


*** SETUP ONCE ***
We recommend to clean all previous builds first.
In project top directory, execute:

mkdir build ; cd build &&  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D BOOST_IGNORE_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -D BUILD_CONN_TOOL=OFF -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -D BUILD_SIMPLE_MINER=OFF -D BUILD_SIMPLE_WALLET=OFF -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D ENABLE_COTIRE=ON -D COTIRE_MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_TARGET_SOURCES=1 -D COTIRE_VERBOSE=ON ..


*** REBUILD ***
Now each time to re-build the project, while in build/ just do:
  make 
or
  make -j 4 

And run ./src/bitmonerod

On windows this is the same, except for other mkdir commnad (just create directory build and run the cmake from inside it!)


*** TESTED ***

This was used on Debian 7 (with updated compiler and boost)
