This file does *** NOT *** necessarily describe the licence he The Monero Project overall.

This text file describes primarly ONLY the licence from OT-Shell code;

It is here because parts or files from Ot-Shell might be used here in The Monero Project
(and such fragments should be marked as such for non-trivial code).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please share :-) This licence can be used e.g. for parts of code that are usable in both open-source FOSS project
Monero and Open Transactions, to share and develop both faster.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The OT-Shell code (again, applicable only to SOME PARTS of the code here!) is licenced as:

/************************************************************
 *
 *  OTNewcli  -- Open Transactions new command line interface
 *  (including parts like: othint, otcli, some util libs, and more)

 *      copyright and related and neighboring rights to this software to
 *      the public domain worldwide. This software is distributed without

 *
 *      You should have received a copy of the CC0 legalcode along with this
 *      work (COPYING file). If not, see:

 *
 *      OTNewcli is developed as a part of OPEN TRANSACTIONS project
 *
 *      Where applicable (under given jurisdiction's law system),
 *      we want to give away our code as CC0 (Creative Commons 0);
 *      However, some parts of code might be not fully ours to licence/decide
 *      (from point of view of given law system),
 *      because they are connecting to other work in some ways.
 *
 *      In any such unclear cases, the general Open Transaction licence as
 *      published by FellowTraveller on GitHub should be applied if possible
 *      (because it clarifies how to deal with linking to work like Lucre code,
 *      OpenSSL code, and so on).
 *
 *      We also allow this code to be released to Public Domain, but again,
 *      we do not verify how is that possible in given law system.
 *
 *      In ANY CASE, we take absolutely NO legal responsibility about
 *      licensing, sharing, using this code (nor patent nor copyright nor
 *      any other law related issues that it might have) e.g. in your   country.
 *
 *      We are not lawyers, and it is up to only You to find out what
 *      laws apply for your case. Do not use any of this code if you don't
 *      agree.

 *
 *   ADDITIONAL PERMISSION under the GNU Affero GPL version 3
 *   section 7: (This paragraph applies only to the LAGPLv3
 *   components listed above.) If you modify this Program, or
 *   any covered work, by linking or combining it with other
 *   code, such other code is not for that reason alone subject
 *   to any of the requirements of the GNU Affero GPL version 3.
 *   (==> This means if you are only using the OT API, then you
 *   don't have to open-source your code--only your changes to
 *   Open-Transactions itself must be open source. Similar to
 *   LGPLv3, except it applies to software-as-a-service, not
 *   just to distributing binaries.)
 *
 *   Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries
 *   used by Open Transactions: This program is released under
 *   the AGPL with the additional exemption that compiling,
 *   linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed. The same is true
 *   for any other open source libraries included in this
 *   project: complete waiver from the AGPL is hereby granted to
 *   compile, link, and/or use them with Open-Transactions,
 *   according to their own terms, as long as the rest of the
 *   Open-Transactions terms remain respected, with regard to
 *   the Open-Transactions code itself.
 *
 *   Lucre License:
 *   This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 *   rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 *   the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 *   See Open-Transactions/src/otlib/lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 *   problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 *   Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 *   Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 *   will continue to operate.
 *   See Lucre on Github:  https://github.com/benlaurie/lucre
